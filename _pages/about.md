I am Teng Xue, a PhD student at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and a research assistant at Robot Learning and Interaction Group (RLI), Idiap Research Institute, supervised by Dr. [Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/). Before joining Idiap/EPFL, I was fortunate to work as a research intern at [ETH RSL](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), supervised by Prof. [Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.MTIxOTEx.TGlzdC8yNDQxLC0xNDI1MTk1NzM1.html), and [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/), supervised by Dr. [Shenli Yuan](https://yuanshenli.com/) and Prof. [J. Kenneth Salisbury](https://sr.stanford.edu/?page_id=1217).

I am broadly interested in planning and control for robotic systems that can physically interact with the surroundings, especially in task and motion planning and contact-rich manipulation. I am deeply interested in the underlying scientific question: **How to cope with the combinatorial complexity arising from the interplay of discrete and continuous variables?** To tackle this, I have investigated different tools from symbolic AI, tensor factorization, and optimal control. The proposed methods have been validated through several long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks. Moreover, I am also interested in addressing this challenge from the learning perspective, such as learning from demonstration.
