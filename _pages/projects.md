<p>The ability to perform in-hand manipulation still remains an unsolved problem; Having this capability would allow robots to perform sophisticated tasks requiring repositioning and reorienting of grasped objects. Based on the work of Roller Grasper V1 before, this project aims to achieve dexterous in-hand manipulation through reinforcement learning and imitation learning, and a manipulation graph would be built to finish kinds of complex target positions and orientations. At this moment. the policy learning in simulation environment has finished, and the next step is to transfer it to real hand. </p>

<h5> Research project, <span class="w3-opacity"> August 2020 - present </span></h5> </div>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
<p>This research project aims to build forecasting and decision support systems for the farming industry. These systems will provide farmers with information about the crop yield and crop growing timing. This information will be crucial for better crop utilisation, optimised harvesting, and labour scheduling in agriculture. In this project, I am researching and implementing forecasting tools for this domain. Additionally, I am part of the team in charge of the data collection systems. This project is in partnership with CERES. For more information about the project, please check the following link to the <a href="https://www.ceresagritech.org/projects/broccoli-crop-forecasting/"> Ceres website.</a> .</p> </div>

<h5>Research project, <span class="w3-opacity"> April, 2019 - Ongoing </span></h5> </div>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>This is an ongoing project at King's College London at the interactionLAb. We are focused on studying methods to enable collaborations between human and robots in agricultural settings. Among the multiple research outputs, our studies show how to improve human opinion towards robot ro-workers. For more information about these topics you can take a look to our <a href="https://adrianxsalazar.github.io/publications/">publications</a>. Within this project, I am particularly interested in adapting computer vision algorithms to make them trustworthy.</p>

<h5> Master thesis project, <span class="w3-opacity"> January 2019 - August 2019 </span></h5> </div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>This is my final master project with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zzLBKmgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Michael Brendam</a> at King's College London. This project evaluates the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of 3D structures. Then, use the learned ditributions to generate new data with the intrinsic characteristics of the original source. We show that is possible to improve the classification of 3D human representations by generating extra data using 3D GANs. Potential application of our findings lies on better human action detection systems for autonomous systems and improving the analysis of 3D medical data.</p>

<h2><b> Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A review of the literature </b></h2>

<h5> Literature review project,   <span class="w3-opacity"> October 2018 - May 2019 </span></h5> </div>
<div class="w3-container">
<p>This project involves a literature review in the area of explainable Artificial Intelligence that I made for the module "advanced research topics" with  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JSARf0MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Sanjay Modgil</a> at King's College London. Our focus was to report a comprehensive review of the trends and development in explainable Artificial Intelligence. So, other researchers can use this review as a starting point to develop explainable AI tools. </p>
