<p>The ability to perform in-hand manipulation still remains an unsolved problem; Having this capability would allow robots to perform sophisticated tasks requiring repositioning and reorienting of grasped objects. Based on the work of Roller Grasper V1 before, this project aims to achieve dexterous in-hand manipulation through reinforcement learning and imitation learning, and a manipulation graph would be built to finish kinds of complex target positions and orientations. At this moment. the policy learning in simulation environment has finished, and the next step is to transfer it to real hand. </p>

<p>The challenge aims to develop a system that can identify objects that are out of place and relocate them to their designated location based on a comprehensive list of appropriate places for objects. This list utilizes a simple "object:furniture" relation model.

To accomplish this, we developed a cutting-edge object detection network that utilizes the state-of-the-art Mask RCNN algorithm to identify both known and unknown objects from the COCO dataset with 100% accuracy. To achieve accurate and efficient object relocation, we employed an advanced grasp planning method based on the detected masks, which resulted in a grasp accuracy of 92%. </p> </div>

<h5> Master thesis project, <span class="w3-opacity"> January 2019 - August 2019 </span></h5> </div>

<div class="w3-container">
<p>This is my final master project with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zzLBKmgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Michael Brendam</a> at King's College London. This project evaluates the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of 3D structures. Then, use the learned ditributions to generate new data with the intrinsic characteristics of the original source. We show that is possible to improve the classification of 3D human representations by generating extra data using 3D GANs. Potential application of our findings lies on better human action detection systems for autonomous systems and improving the analysis of 3D medical data.</p>

<h2><b> Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A review of the literature </b></h2>

<h5> Literature review project,   <span class="w3-opacity"> October 2018 - May 2019 </span></h5> </div>
<div class="w3-container">
<p>This project involves a literature review in the area of explainable Artificial Intelligence that I made for the module "advanced research topics" with  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JSARf0MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Sanjay Modgil</a> at King's College London. Our focus was to report a comprehensive review of the trends and development in explainable Artificial Intelligence. So, other researchers can use this review as a starting point to develop explainable AI tools. </p>
